In recent years, Natural Language Processing (NLP) has become increasingly popular for analyzing text data in various domains, including music. Song lyrics are an exciting and rich source of text data, offering insights into the emotions, themes, and cultural contexts of songs. In this report, we discuss the development of an NLP library class in Python specifically designed for song lyrics analysis. Our library aims to extract useful insights from song lyrics by leveraging various NLP and visualization techniques to help users better understand and explore the patterns and relationships in song lyrics. Our library can potentially be useful for music researchers, songwriters, and enthusiasts who want to gain a deeper understanding of the language and meaning of song lyrics. Although we intended the library to be used for song lyrics, we built it in a generalizable fashion to be used in other domains of text analysis such as political speeches, news articles, and books to name a few exterior use cases.
